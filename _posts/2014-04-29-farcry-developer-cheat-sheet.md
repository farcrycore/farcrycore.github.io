[Blair](http://discourse.farcrycore.org/users/blair) and the [Daemonite team](http://www.daemon.com.au) have rustled up a simple two page "cheat sheet" for FarCry developers. The sheet highlights commonly used tags, functions and decorators. It's only a first stab, so let us know what's missing and what you might find useful.
