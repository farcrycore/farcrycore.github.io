> Fandango: A foolish or useless act or thing.

![Fandango Home Page](http://daemonite.github.io/fandango/project-asset/img/home.png)

The Fandango (v6.2.x) release of [FarCry Core for ColdFusion][2] shipped with a brand new HTML5 design by the same name. This design replaced the original [Mollio design][3] as the default theme to ship with the FarCry installer.  

<!--more-->

Released under the GPL and FarCry Commercial License, [Fandango can be forked/cloned][5] from our GitHub repo.  Or seen online at the [Fandango project site][4].

While you can always get the fully integrated FarCry template skeleton as part of the installer, we find it useful to maintain [a reference site in pure HTML/CSS][4].  Plus its an opportunity for non-FarCry users to do something with the design if they desire.

Lovingly crafted by [Daemonite][1] Justin Carter (@justincarter) for the [FarCry][2] community.
