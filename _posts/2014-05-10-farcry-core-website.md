A new, [true-blue web site](http://www.farcrycore.org) to go with the release of FarCry 7.0. 

Daemonite [@justincarter](http://discourse.farcrycore.org/users/justincarter) crafted the "flat meets farcry webtop" palette design, and deployed the lot into the CloudBees java Paas.

### A few changes

With the move to the [new community forum](http://discourse.farcrycore.org) we've made a few changes to the location of things:

- **Blog** is now [here at the blog](http://blog.farcrycore.org) :) 
- **Portfolio** is a [hosted category of wonder called **builtwith** on the forum](http://discourse.farcrycore.org/category/builtwith)
- **Help** is now [**Support**](http://www.farcrycore.org/support)

### `project-farcrycore`

We've released the entire website as a `project skeleton` that folks can download and dissect. A little bit rudimentary behind the scenes just now, but we'll be improving the skeleton day by day as we update the website.
