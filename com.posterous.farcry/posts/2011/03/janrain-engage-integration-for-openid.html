<div>The <strong>farcryrpxud</strong> plugin has been out for a while, but it recently got some awesome updates.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>farcryrpxud</strong> has a funny name on account of the service formally known as RPX changing name to Janrain Engage. &nbsp;It's basically a straight up user directory for Janrain's authentication proxy service that provides support for heaps of different providers including openid, twitter and facebook.</div>
<p />
<div>You can get hold of the plugin, along with installation instructions on the FarCry WIKI:</div>
<div><a href="https://farcry.jira.com/wiki/display/RPX/Home">https://farcry.jira.com/wiki/display/RPX/Home</a></div>
<p />
<div>Recent changes allow you to map your providers domain to a specific user group within FarCry security, and by extension roles and permissions.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>For example, if you have a Google Apps account for your company you can activate OpenID and allow anyone within the domain to login as an administrator -- no need to set up the user. Best of all, if you have lots of sites you look after you only have to set up the plugin and anyone on staff that needs it can reach the sites webtop. &nbsp;When the person leaves the company you just disable their account and all their web site access is automatically rescinded.</div>
<p />
<div>Sweet!</div>
