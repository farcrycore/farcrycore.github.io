<h3>Drafts that ain't "draft"</h3>

<div class='post_body'><p>Whenever you go to edit a "versioned"&nbsp;content type like a standard web page or a news content item, FarCry creates an underlying draft item so your changes are not seen by the public until you "send them live".</p>
<p>Sometimes you just want to check the properties of a content item, or you start editing and realise you didn't want to change the content afterall. &nbsp;You end up with a bunch of draft items. And given a few weeks (sometimes hours) you can't remember whether or not there's a significant change there at all.</p>
<p>Ugh. &nbsp;Hate that.</p>

FarCry 6.2 has a diffing engine that lets contributors quickly visualise the difference between versions (under the History tab). &nbsp;But a nice little UX touch we've added is to highlight when the underlying DRAFT item is not changes so you can choose to discard it immediately.</p>
<p>Yep. &nbsp;Love that :)</p></div>
