<div class='post_body'><p>A really sweet feature of FarCry for few years now is the ability to crop images from your image library to exactly fit your web design. &nbsp;It's one of those classic tailor made options that reduces the pain of managing content online by allowing you to do what you need without powering up Photoshop (or image editor of choice).</p>
<p />
<div>A couple of subtle touches in the recently released FarCry 6.2.3 give you immediate feedback on your crop. &nbsp;If the crop is smaller than the image dimensions (ie. your crop will reduce image quality) you get a warning and a red background. &nbsp;As soon as you increase the crop to a size above the dimensions of the final image the warning goes and the background turns green.</div>

<div>FarCry rocks :)</div>
