<h3>5.1 to 5.2 Upgrade - 404 on Webskins</h3>

<div class='post_body'>Friendly URLs got a bit of an update in 5.2, and as a result you might <br />get 404 errors on some of your webskins. This will likely take the <br />shape of a hard 404 page display. I've mostly ran into the change on <br />webtop webskins. The error will look something like the following: <p /> <code> 
Not Found 
The requested URL /farcry-ud-login/displayLoginRedirection was not 
found on this server. 
</code> <p /> As you can see the URL is a bit friendlier than in 5.1. The <br />"farcry-ud-login" is actually the file farLogin.cfc. The new URL <br />display is derived from the "displayname" attribute on the cfc: <br />displayname="Farcry UD Login" in this example. I am getting a bit off <br />topic here; the point being that the webskin has not moved, nor has <br />the code that looks for the webskin, only the display of the <br />ContentType in the URL has changed. <p /> The only reason I mention the friendly URL / webskin bit here is <br />because I initially thought that change was causing the error; <br />however, the problem is linked to the "farcry" alias you likely have <br />in Apache. The crux of the fix is you'll need to update your friendly <br />URL re-write rule. A typical FarCry rewrite rule looks like the <br />following: <p /> <code> 
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} 
!(/CFIDE|/farcry|/webtop|/flex2gateway|/flashservices|/papi|/mxunit|/javaloader|/tests) 
RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9\/\-\%:\[\]\{\}\|\;\&lt;\&gt;\?\,\*\!\@\#\$\ 
\(\)\^_`~]*)$ /index.cfm?furl=$1 [L,PT,QSA] 
</code> <p /> and to fix the 404 you'll need to update it like so: <p /> <code> 
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} 
!(/CFIDE|/farcry|/webtop|/flex2gateway|/flashservices|/papi|/mxunit|/javaloader|/tests)(/|$) 
RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9\/\-\%:\[\]\{\}\|\;\&lt;\&gt;\?\,\*\!\@\#\$\ 
\(\)\^_`~]*)$ /index.cfm?furl=$1 [L,PT,QSA] 
</code> <p /> Note the addition of the "(/|$)" in the rewrite condition. <p /> Once you've made that change and restarted Apache, all should be well.</div>
