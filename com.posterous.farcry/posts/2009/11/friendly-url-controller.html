<div class='post_body'><p>The FarCry Core framework takes cues from the URL to determine what content instance or content type and what view should be rendered in&nbsp;the browser. These variables are closely integrated with the Friendly URL engine to provide good looking URLs that can drive the frameworks&nbsp;output. Understanding how the URL is interpreted by the framework is an important part of FarCry development. <p /> Motley, the FarCry 5.2 release, has some awesome changes to the way the controller interprets the URL. The upshot of all this is improved&nbsp;management of friendly URLs (which has always been pretty special in FarCry) but also the option to create your own "constructed" URLs&nbsp;where you nominate the type and views you want right there in the address bar. Another massive improvement is the ability to add&nbsp;parameters to the end of Friendly URLs (without a ? and &amp;). <p /> We've started a nuts and bolts reference page to describe what is going on. We'll be improving this over time with more layman examples: <br /><a href="http://docs.farcrycms.org/display/FCDEV50/Friendly+URL+Controller">http://docs.farcrycms.org/display/FCDEV50/Friendly+URL+Controller</a> <p /> Setting up Friendly URLs for your project is pretty straightforward but you will need the ability to apply a rewrite rule to your webserver. Details for Apache and IIS available here: <br /><a href="http://docs.farcrycms.org/display/FCDEV50/Friendly+URLs">http://docs.farcrycms.org/display/FCDEV50/Friendly+URLs</a><p /> Enjoy</p></div>
