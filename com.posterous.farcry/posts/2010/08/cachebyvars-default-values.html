<div class='post_body'><p>cacheByVars is a view decorator who's values are used by the caching layer to identify unique views of the same webskin and object. For example, a single webskin has a paginated result set that means there is a different output depending on page number using something like URL.page. <p /> The vars that might impact the caching are accessed and hashed BEFORE the webskin is executed in order to identify if that execution can be avoided. Unfortunately, there can be a problem if the webskin/view cfparam's one of these variables: the cache layer looks for an item with a null for that variable and doesn't find it, then afterwards caches the item where the variable DOES have a value. <p /> You'll see a fix for this coming through in 6.0.6, where we've added support for defining a default cacheByVars value in the decorator:</p>
<p>&lt;!--- @@cacheByVars: url.page:1 ---&gt; <p /> In cases where the variable is not found by the caching layer, it is  treated as being equal to the specified value instead. Variables with no  defaults are still supported.&nbsp;</p></div>
