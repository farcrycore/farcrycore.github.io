<div class='post_body'>      Profiling code and logging output for a request is painful. It usually involves checking the IP address or URL variable to make sure only a developer sees it, and has to be outputed using cfdump/cfoutput followed by an abort.<p />  Blair has added support for profile=1. Just tack it onto the end of your URL when you are developing. (You'll need to wait for 6.0.6 <a href="https://farcry.jira.com/browse/FC-2330" class="moz-txt-link-freetext">https://farcry.jira.com/browse/FC-2330</a> or be running from the p600 maintenance branch)<p />  <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />  If the "tray menu" is showing (ie. you have logged into the webtop earlier with admin permmissions), this mode starts tracking calls to application.fapi.addProfilePoint(section,label) and application.fapi.addRequestLog(text).<p />  The profile functionality is a little bit primitive at this stage, but it's enough to show relative times between points. FarCry Core has a few points already in place to track request initialisation and view execution.<p />  <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />  The logging is also simple; a list of strings. Timestamps are recorded but not outputed. Core has logging for cache hits and misses.<p />  <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
