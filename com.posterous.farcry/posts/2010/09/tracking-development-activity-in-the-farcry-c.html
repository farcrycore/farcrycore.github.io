<div class='post_body'>All FarCry Community projects are managed through a single Jira Studio instance (thanks to our friends at Atlassian). That includes code commits across the framework, related plugins and projects, in additioni to WIKI documentation changes, and public code reviews. <p /> You can track the lot in your favourite feed reader by subscribing to the universal activity feed: <br /><a href="https://farcry.jira.com/plugins/servlet/streams">https://farcry.jira.com/plugins/servlet/streams</a> <p /> Of course if you just want to watch a particular code base, wiki or even a single issue try the integrated watch features. You can create your own RSS/ATOM feed, use one of the many defaults, or have changes emailed to your in-box daily. Look out for the standard webfeed icon or check under the "Tools" menu for watch options. <p /> Enjoy!</div>
