<h3>Don't use dmLink to schedule content items in the site tree</h3>

<div class='post_body'>Across a few different clients we see folks using the "link" (aka dmLink) content type to schedule content items in the site overview tree. This is bad -- never use dmLink objects to schedule things in the tree. <p /> Typically contributors are doing this as a way to bind content items to a menu folder (aka dmnavigation) in the tree. By default only link (dmLink), web page (dmHTML) and includes (dmInclude) can be scheduled in the tree -- so if you have something other than those three the link option seems reasonable. <p /> However, FarCry is designed to allow you to nominate other content types to be used in the tree too. If contributors need a specific content type in the tree you just need to update the content type's component metadata to enable tree use, specifically: <p /> bUseInTree="true" <p /> Once bUseInTree is set to true your contributors can just add the content type to the tree directly -- absolutely no link (dmLink) needed. This way the content item can maintain a position in the hierachy, has a great looking friendly url to boot. <p /> Enjoy!</div>
