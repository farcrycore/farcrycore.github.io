<div class='post_body'>      FarCry has two distinct approaches to managing multiple web sites under a single installation: &#8220;multiple sites&#8221; and &#8220;sub-sites&#8221;. <p />  As a general rule of thumb, if sites do not share content then they should be treated as distinct projects - the multiple sites approach. On the other hand, if a site shares a significant amount of content with another site then you may consider creating a single application with embedded sub-sites.<p />  --// Multiple Sites<p />  The &#8220;Multiple Site&#8221; approach follows creating distinct projects for each web application. These sites may share a common code base through the use of plugins.&nbsp; Specifically each application has its own logical database.<p />  <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />  --// Sub-Sites<p />  The &#8220;Sub-Site&#8221; approach uses a single application to manage all the different sub-sites. All content is housed in a single logical database. The sub-sites each load a unique set of plugins at run time; the combination of plugins determining the look and feel and specific functionality available to each sub-site.<p />  The information hierarchy of each sub-site is managed in a separate branch of the site overview tree, allowing each subsite to have its own unique sitemap. Dynamic content is typically segmented between sub-sites using categories.<p />  <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />  Daemon has a "Sub Sites" plugin available for commercial license holders that greatly simplifies the configuration and development of sub-site installations. Contact us if you're interested.</div>

<div class='response_body'>I should note in the case of multiple-sites (ie. separate applications sharing similar code bases) the "sharing" is typically a copy of the entire code base via an external, rather than having each app reference the one physical code base.</div>
