<div class='post_body'><p>As you likely know ft:processForm is used quite frequently in FarCry to handle form posts - the "action page" for the old-school developers out there. A very simple ft:processForm tag looks like the following: <p /> <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/274936">https://gist.github.com/274936</a></p><p /> The above code simply outputs "Blarg" and a timestamp. To get this code to run, you would typically create an ft:form with an ft:button like so: <p /> <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/274940">https://gist.github.com/274940</a></p><p /> The "value" attribute on the ft:button corresponds to the "action" attribute on the ft:processForm. The "value" to "action" matching will cause the block of code to run (thereby supporting many buttons to many actions on the same form). <p /> ft:button has several attributes to alter the display the button <a href="http://docs.farcrycore.org/trunk/tags/farcry-core-tags-ft-button.html">http://docs.farcrycore.org/trunk/tags/farcry-core-tags-ft-button.html</a> - renderType, Class, and Style for example. <p /> However, sometimes you need more control over a form submission element. Perhaps you need a graphic *and* a bit of text, or you want to wrap a div with a link (which isn't valid, but who am I to judge.)  In cases where you need more control over the contents of the form submission link you can use skin:buildLink. <p /> To use skin:buildLink you simply supply the "href" attribute with the javascript function "btnSubmit". The "btnSubmit" function is what ft:button winds up calling. "btnSubmit" takes two parameters - the form name, and the action to perform. To change the ft:button example above to be a skin:buildLink call we could do the following: <p /> <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/274939">https://gist.github.com/274939</a></p><p /> Of course, you have to include the skin tag library as well as the formtool library: <p /> <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/274937">https://gist.github.com/274937</a></p></p></div>
