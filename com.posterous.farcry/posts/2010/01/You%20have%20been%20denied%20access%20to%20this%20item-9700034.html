<div class='post_body'>      A very cool feature of FarCry is the ability to actually secure views by role.&nbsp; "  You have been denied access to this item" is the standard response from the FarCry "view stack" when a user is attempting to display a webskin for which their role does not have permission.&nbsp; <p />  FarCry installs with a default list of roles and webskin permissions.&nbsp; For example, by default the "anonymous" role is allowed to view any webskin that starts display* but little else.&nbsp; If you are not following the display* prefix standard for public templates then you will need to add the appropriate prefix to your roles under "Admin &gt; Roles" in the webtop admin area.<p />  <div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p />  You can get in and modify these security settings as needed to suit your own particular naming conventions for views.</div>
