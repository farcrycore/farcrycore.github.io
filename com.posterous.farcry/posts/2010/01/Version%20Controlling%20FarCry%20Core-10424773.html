<div class='post_body'>The FarCry Framework, and individual FarCry Plugins are versioned independently and have their own release cycles. Daemon periodically releases what is called a “community distribution” incorporating the framework and a popular set of plugins confirmed to be fully compatible. <p /> Upon each major version release of the framework (for example, 5.0.0 or 5.1.0) a maintenance branch is created. All maintenance bug fixes and enhancements are checked into this branch, and regularly merged into the code mainline (./trunk). The branch is reserved for maintenance fixes only and is consequently very stable. <p /> Periodically, fixes in the maintenance branches are rolled up, tested, and then released as a tagged milestone release. Tagged milestones are available direct from Subversion or as distributed ZIP archives of all the relevant files.</div>
