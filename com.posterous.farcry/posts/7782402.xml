	<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've been going through a rethink on how FarCry documentation should <br />be done. We're finding that, while there is heaps of documentation, <br />people are having a hard time finding specific solutions. We're <br />really proud of the documentation on <a href="http://docs.farcrycms.org/">http://docs.farcrycms.org/</a>, but <br />realise it doesn't help finding, say, what "wizardID" is on <br />; what it's supposed to do, or that it is even there. <p /> FarCry has an extensive ability to do inline documentation within the <br />code, and we've started to try to pull that out and harness it a bit <br />better. The goal is to get up to date, easy to grep help for FarCry <br />as close to your code writing as possible (and searchable via <br />google++). Additionally, we are working towards smaller, example <br />focused bits. <p /> We've allocated "daemon time" to try to get a base documentation <br />project up, and we have <a href="http://docs.farcrycore.org/">http://docs.farcrycore.org/</a> in a very, very <br />beta state (looks horrible too). However, we'd like to get some <br />feedback on it's content. Additionally, the CFEclipse dictionary, <br />and the textmate bundle are generated along side the documentation so <br />they should auto improve as the documentation improves. <p /> The main page has links to 6 versions of FarCry. p510 is FarCry 5.1.0 <br />documentation, p520 is the head of 5.2.x branch of FarCry (not <br />officially released but mostly stable), and trunk is the main line <br />development for the next major release ie. 5.3 codenamed "Formality" <br />(for all you bleeding edgers). <p /> The top 3 links are documentation of the base of FarCry - Tags, Types, <br />and Components. This is the bare core without any plugins. The bottom <br />3 links are documentation of FarCry with the CMS plugin installed - <br />Tags, Types, and Components. They are only offered as downloadable <br />zips at this time. <p /> Some important things to note <p /> - Deprecated items are not currently being marked as such. This will <br />happen as time allows. <br />- The documentation itself is a bit sparse still. We need to get more <br />documentation actually typed into the code - patches welcome :-D <br />- The Components tree is all Grey because nothing is currently marked <br />as an documented (though most of it is). See "fapi" or "fu" for a <br />good list of things you'll likely want to know. The "scope" part of <br />the Components is very helpful - thats where you can find the method <br />at runtime (if it's auto created). <br />- We don't have any plans to back port this to earlier versions <p /> Enjoy! <p /> PS. Many thanks to Rob for his automated builder magic, and Blair for <br />his doco parsing skills]]></content:encoded>
