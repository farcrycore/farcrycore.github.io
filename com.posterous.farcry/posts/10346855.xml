	<content:encoded><![CDATA[FarCry was released to open source in April 2003. Since that time we have averaged a major release every 6-9 months or so, interspersed with a variety of maintenance or patch releases. <p /> We follow a three number versioning policy common to many open source projects. For example, a recent milestone release was 5.2.7. <p /> The first number designates the principal version number and will not change unless a significant backward compatibility issue is introduced to the code base. For example, 4.x to 5.0 incorporated a complete rewrite of the underlying security model. This has the potential to cause existing installations to rewrite portions of their code base to accommodate the changes. Testing before deploying to production is essential. <p /> The second number designates a “major release” incorporating a significant increase in functionality. For example, 5.0 to 5.1 made significant improvements to the SEO of the CMS. Point releases may include minor schema changes or code adjustments, but generally installations that follow “best practice” installation should be able to upgrade without significant impact. Testing before deploying to production environments is highly recommended. <p /> The third number is a patch release and represents a collection of bug fixes, minor enhancements or usability improvements. A patch is considered a very low risk update and community members are actively encouraged to deploy patches as and when they are made available.]]></content:encoded>
